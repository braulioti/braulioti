# Hi, I'm Bráulio Figueiredo.

I have been a programmer for over 27 years, driven by curiosity and a constant search for new challenges. Throughout my career, I have worked on developing robust solutions in NodeJS, Angular, and PostgreSQL, contributing to high-responsibility projects such as hospital monitoring systems, fraud detection platforms, and corporate automation tools. I have increasingly explored the potential of artificial intelligence applied to data analysis, security, and operational efficiency—areas that also guide my studies and the content I create. Currently, I lead initiatives such as intelligent browser plugins, proprietary platforms, and innovative social networks, always combining creativity, technical precision, and the desire to transform complex ideas into real, accessible solutions.
